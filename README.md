# Project 2: Gradebook 

Gradebook is a school management software designed to give up-to-date attendance records from all your teachers in real-time. Teachers and student support staff can overview daily attendance records as well as individual student profiles. Teachers, Administrators and Support staff can communicate quickly on student attendance issues through the integration of the Twilio API that fosters connections through messages, email to intelligent chatbots. 

# Motivation 

Gradebook was created to quickly integrate tertiary staff into the school administration databases without the added burden of learning antiquated software that engenders inefficient ways of working.
